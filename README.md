## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Victor, a French front-end developer. Currently working as Lead front-end engineer at [Totem Paris](https://totem.paris)

My stack is primarily based on Nuxt.js/Vue.js, Typescript, GraphQL and TailwindCSS.
Experience with Gitlab CI, Github Actions.
I love to make everything type-safe.

This includes 5 librairies that I use in all my company's projects in production (Currently ~11)
- [vue-chart-3](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/vue-chart-3)
- [simple-graphql-to-typescript](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/simple-graphql-to-typescript)
- [vuex-typed-modules](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/vuex-typed-modules)
- [nuxt-typed-router](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/nuxt-typed-router)
- [nuxt-assets-paths](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/nuxt-assets-paths)
